My neovim config heavily inspired by 
- <https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch>
- <https://github.com/bibjaw99/workstation/tree/master/.config/nvim>

**What changed?**
- Moved from [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager!

## How to use my config:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reaper8055/nvim-config.git $HOME/.config/nvim/
```
